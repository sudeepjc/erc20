Commands to be issued to test the ERC20 Token and Faucet

truffle deploy
>migrate
> MyERC20.deployed(). then( instance => { instance.balanceOf(accounts[0]).then(console.log) })
// shows balance as 20000.
// approve transfer of the required amount and allow Faucet to perform this transfer
> MyERC20.deployed(). then( instance => { instance.approve( MyERC20Faucet.address, 1000) })
// let accounts[1] make the transfer
> MyERC20Faucet.deployed(). then( instance => { instance.withdraw( 1000, {from:accounts[1]}) } )
// now check the balance from the first command
// it should show as 19000.
// Also check the balance of accounts[1]
// it should be set to 1000
